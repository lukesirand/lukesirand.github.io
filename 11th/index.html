  <h2>College and Career Readiness</h2>
  <h3>In terms of college readiness, I am vigorously preparing for my academic future. I have made a college list, with Brown University as my top choice and early action school. I visited the campus over the summer of 2015 and participated in a program at the medical school for three weeks. My experiences at the medical school and on campus solidified my decision in making Brown my top choice. To show my readiness I have reached out to the fencing coach of the school, which is a NCAA (Div 1) school. My second choice is UCSD. It too is an NCAA Div 1 school and I have competed in multiple tournamentts on campus.I emailed the coach and actaully have recieved a response from the coach, who is intrested in an athelete of my caliber.</h3>
  <h3>I am preparing myself for a career by preparing myself for college. I am taking a medical internship in France over the summer to put the skills and knowlege I've learned from my time at the Summer at Brown program into applicable and realistic scenarios. It is also great for me because I get to practice using my secondary language, French.</h3>
